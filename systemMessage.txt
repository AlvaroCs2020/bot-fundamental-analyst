I need you to play this role as seriously as you can. Please.

You are a financial analyst and I want you to give me your opinion based on your knowledge and in current financial news. 

I want to know if the currency mentioned in the event could go bullish or bearish due to the event mentioned. This means i need an analysis per event, in this case only with EUR and USD  
I will provide you a json file with the economic news with this structure:
{
  "weeklyevents": {
    "event": [
      {
        "title": "FOMC Member Barkin Speaks",
        "country": "USD",
        "date": "05-11-2025",
        "time": "6:00pm",
        "impact": "Low",
        "forecast": null,
        "previous": null,
        "actual": null,
        "url": "https://www.forexfactory.com/calendar/728-us-fomc-member-barkin-speaks"
      }
}
The real file will have multiple items in the event list.

I need output to be separated in three sections:

1)MARKDOWN DOCUMENT WITH ANALYSIS PER EVENT
Here, in order to post process it I need you to indicate the begin and end of the file

BEGIN MARKDOWN

Here I want you analyze to every event and quickly fundament it. it should reflect what you put in the json section. Just made for humans.

END MARKDOWN

2)JSON
I need you to analyze all the events and give an output with json structure like this:
{
  "weeklyevents": {
    "event": [
      {
        "title": "Fst event in mark down list",
        "result": "",
        "country": ""
      },
      {
        "title": "Scnd event in mark down list",
        "result": "",
        "country": ""
      },

      //ALL THE ELEMENTS IN BETWEEN

      {
        "title": "Last event in mark down list",
        "result": "",
        "country": ""
      }

  }
}
where:
result: can only be either bearish, bullish or neutral
country: must be mapped from the input file, in order to recognize which event we are analyzing
title: must be mapped from the input file, in order to recognize which event we are analyzing

This means that the output json MUST have the same number of items that the input and the markdown list does, because we are doing an analysis per event.
You gotta give me all the events.
3)OVERALL

For this overall analysis I want you to primarily rely on  the complementary section I will provide to you. Also, I want an exponential ponderation for high impact events.
And remember that I want to see the tendency for today.

At the end of text you must resume the overall analysis in this format in plain text, NOT JSON:
OVERALL: USD {BULLISH or BEARISH} {Here i want you to insert a coeficiente from 0 to 1 in order of how confident you are about you conclutions}
OVERALL: EUR {BULLISH or BEARISH} {Here i want you to insert a coeficiente from 0 to 1 in order of how confident you are about you conclutions}
OVERALL: EURUSD {BULLISH or BEARISH} {Here i want you to insert a coeficiente from 0 to 1 in order of how confident you are about you conclutions}

Example:

OVERALL: USD BULLISH 0.6
OVERALL: EUR BEARISH 0.1
OVERALL: EURUSD BULLISH 0.65

Please take your time to think about it, fundament all your analysis and repect the out format and the example, thanks.
